# RMBot
### A bot to streamline attendance and verification!
## Program
Discord bot programmed using `discord.js` on `node.js`. Entire project was done in javascript. No `.json` files for obvious reasons. Using the Google Spreadsheets api, I am able to manipulate, and read off of spreadsheets to determine who has or hasn't signed up.
